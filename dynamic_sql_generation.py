    > INSTRUCTIONS:
        - understand the user question properly, use date_logic_and_fiscal_rules for calculating dates etc.
        - learn concept through examples and generate ssms sql query by understanding user query properly.
        very imp: Whenever the query contains location filters such as CITY, STATE, REGION, PLANT_NAME, Short_Name then SQL must join DW.fSales (f) with DW.dSalesOfficeMaster (d) using f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT and filter on the location fields from d. Additionally, always include d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office'
        "SalesQuantity Logic: If the question refers to a single specific day (e.g., 'yesterday', 'on 5th June 2025'), use the total SalesQuantity without dividing. If the question refers to a date range (e.g., 'last week', 'MTD', 'QTD', 'YTD', or two dates), then divide the total SalesQuantity by the number of days in that range to calculate the daily average — do not assume 1 day for ranges."
        This makes it clear: # Single day → no division #Range → divide by actual number of days #Never assume 1 when it's a range
    **"livo": "[livo means strictly you have to map like this: SELECT SUM(SalesQuantity) FROM DW.fSales WHERE MaterialCode IN ('30769', '30704', '30706')]",**
    NOTE : Salesoffice means consider  like(select PLANT_NAME or short_name from DW.dSalesOfficeMaster)
    NOTE : Region means consider like (select REGION_NAME from DW.dSalesOfficeMaster)

    MAIN LOGIC:
       #usecase 1: sale quantity or volume or sale calculation:  
    examples:

    > INSTRUCTIONS:
        - understand the user question properly, use date_logic_and_fiscal_rules for calculating dates etc.
        ** very important: if any one asked question relating to the these columns : CITY,STATE,REGION_NAME,Short_Name then join like - join DW.fSales with DW.dSalesOfficeMaster like : select * from dw.fSales f inner join DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d on f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT and d.[Sales Offcie Type]='sales Office'
        - learn concept through Main logic examples and generate ssms sql query by understanding user query properly.

    MAIN LOGIC:
    **Important Note: The following examples cover common ways users may ask about UBC  If a user query differs in wording or format, interpret the intent and generate the SQL by adapting the logic shown in these examples. Always use them as reference patterns for solving similar queries.**

    =>usecase 1: 
    MODEL 1: UNIQUE BILLING COUNT OR UNIQUE BILLING CUSTOMERS: -> ubc or unique billing count or unique billing customers:
        meaning: Number of unique customers based on the CustomerID column in Dw.fsales table.
        eg 1)what is unique billing count yesterday?  -> sql query: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT BillingDocument) AS UniqueBillingCount_Yesterday FROM Dw.fsales WHERE CAST(BillingDate AS DATE) = CAST(GETDATE() - 1 AS DATE);
        eg 2) what is dne yesterday?  -> sql query: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT BillingDocument) AS UniqueBillingCount_Yesterday FROM Dw.fsales WHERE CAST(BillingDate AS DATE) = CAST(GETDATE() - 1 AS DATE);
        eg 3) what is unique billed customers yesterday ? -> SQl: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT BillingDocument) AS UniqueBillingCount_Yesterday FROM Dw.fsales WHERE CAST(BillingDate AS DATE) = CAST(GETDATE() - 1 AS DATE);

    MODEL 3: UNBILLED CUSTOMERS: means customers who made a purchase in the previous month but did not make any purchase in the current month. -> UNBILLED customers or not billed customers: 
        meaning: Unbilled customers are those customers who made a purchase (were billed) in the previous month but did not make any purchase (were not billed) in the current month.
        eg 1)who are unbilled customers from the agents for April 2025 ?-> sql query: WITH CustomersBilledInApril AS (SELECT DISTINCT CustomerID FROM Dw.fSales WHERE BillingDate >= '2025-04-01' AND BillingDate < '2025-05-01' AND CustomerGroup = 'agents'), CustomersBilledInMarch AS (SELECT DISTINCT CustomerID FROM Dw.fSales WHERE BillingDate >= '2025-03-01' AND BillingDate < '2025-04-01' AND CustomerGroup = 'agents'), UnbilledCustomers AS (SELECT m.CustomerID FROM CustomersBilledInMarch m LEFT JOIN CustomersBilledInApril a ON m.CustomerID = a.CustomerID WHERE a.CustomerID IS NULL) SELECT 'Count' AS Type, CAST(COUNT(*) AS VARCHAR) AS Value FROM UnbilledCustomers UNION ALL SELECT 'CustomerID' AS Type, CAST(CustomerID AS VARCHAR) AS Value FROM UnbilledCustomers;IMPORTANT OBSERVATION: user just mentiond the single month but we automatically compares with its previous month.
        eg 2)show me who are ubilled customers from the agents in hso1 for april 2025? -> sql query: WITH CustomersBilledInApril AS (SELECT DISTINCT f.CustomerID FROM Dw.fSales f JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office' WHERE f.BillingDate >= '2025-04-01' AND f.BillingDate < '2025-05-01' AND f.CustomerGroup = 'agents' AND d.Short_Name = 'hso 1'), CustomersBilledInMarch AS (SELECT DISTINCT f.CustomerID FROM Dw.fSales f JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office' WHERE f.BillingDate >= '2025-03-01' AND f.BillingDate < '2025-04-01' AND f.CustomerGroup = 'agents' AND d.Short_Name = 'hso 1'), UnbilledCustomers AS (SELECT m.CustomerID FROM CustomersBilledInMarch m LEFT JOIN CustomersBilledInApril a ON m.CustomerID = a.CustomerID WHERE a.CustomerID IS NULL) SELECT 'Count' AS Type, CAST(COUNT(*) AS VARCHAR) AS Value FROM UnbilledCustomers UNION ALL SELECT 'CustomerID' AS Type, CAST(CustomerID AS VARCHAR) AS Value FROM UnbilledCustomers;
    STRICT NOTE: DON'T Get confused between Billed and unbilled customers, BILLED CUSTOMERS-> MODEL 1 and UNBILLED CUSTOMERS -> MODEL 2. 
     
     => usecase 2:  sale quantity or volume or sale : always divide 
    meaning: The total number of units (or liters, kilograms, etc.) of a product that were sold in a specific period. that is divide with the time period    
            - 1) what is sale quantity of milk yesterday? -> sql query: SELECT SUM(SalesQuantity)/1 AS MilkSalesQuantity_Yesterday FROM Dw.fsales WHERE CAST(BillingDate AS DATE) = CAST(GETDATE() - 1 AS DATE) AND ProductHeirachy1 = 'MILK';  -- you has to find which column the user mentioned product belongs to

            like this you has to dynamically adjust to user query and generate the sql query with proper column names and date filters they may ask by mentioning CITY,STATE, REGION_NAME, Short_Name etc and also by date filters like mtd,qtd, ytd. donot get confused just think and genarete based upon the financial year (starts on 1st April of the current year & ends on 31st March of the following year)
            Important: Always calculate SalesQuantity as a daily average by dividing SUM(SalesQuantity) by the number of days in the period—use full days for past periods, and for the current month, divide only up to yesterday (e.g., if today is May 23, 2025, divide May data by 22 days).

    > INSTRUCTIONS:
        - understand the user question properly, use date_logic_and_fiscal_rules for calculating dates etc.
        very important: - if any one asked question relating to the these columns : CITY,STATE,REGION_NAME,Short_Name then join like - join DW.fSales with DW.dSalesOfficeMaster like : select * from dw.fSales f inner join DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d on f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT and d.[Sales Offcie Type]='sales Office'
        - learn concept through Main logic examples and generate ssms sql query by understanding user query properly.

    MAIN LOGIC:
    -> month on month comparison: print avg sale along with percentage
            meaning: Month-on-Month comparison is a way to measure how a metric (here, sales quantity) changes from one month to the next, usually expressed as a percentage growth or decline. Growth% = ((Current - Previous) / Previous) * 100) where: Current = Average daily sales quantity in the current month, Previous = Average daily sales quantity in the previous month, If the current month is partial (meaning the month is still ongoing and not complete), only consider sales and days up to yesterday instead of the full month. Additional important Note on Input Dates: 1) If the user provides a date range covering two months or more, use the above MoM formula to compare the specified months. 2)If the user mentions only a single month, then instead of comparing with the previous month, compare the product's sales in that month with the same month in the previous year (Year-on-Year comparison for that month).
  
            MODEL 1: If the user provides a date range covering two months or more, use the above MoM formula to compare the specified months.
            examples:

            eg 2) what is the month on month growth of milk in march 2024  and april 2024 ? sql-> WITH CurrentMonth AS (SELECT SUM(SalesQuantity) AS TotalSales, DAY(EOMONTH('2024-03-01')) AS DaysInMonth FROM Dw.fsales WHERE ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk' AND BillingDate >= '2024-03-01' AND BillingDate < '2024-04-01'), PreviousMonth AS (SELECT SUM(SalesQuantity) AS TotalSales, DAY(EOMONTH('2024-04-01')) AS DaysInMonth FROM Dw.fsales WHERE ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk' AND BillingDate >= '2024-04-01' AND BillingDate < '2024-05-01'), MoMGrowth AS (SELECT ROUND(CAST(CurrentMonth.TotalSales AS FLOAT) / NULLIF(CurrentMonth.DaysInMonth, 0) / 1000.0, 2) AS AvgCurrent, ROUND(CAST(PreviousMonth.TotalSales AS FLOAT) / NULLIF(PreviousMonth.DaysInMonth, 0) / 1000.0, 2) AS AvgPrevious FROM CurrentMonth, PreviousMonth) SELECT FORMAT(AvgCurrent, 'N2') AS AvgCurrent, FORMAT(AvgPrevious, 'N2') AS AvgPrevious, FORMAT(AvgCurrent - AvgPrevious, 'N2') AS Variance, FORMAT(CASE WHEN AvgPrevious = 0 THEN NULL ELSE ROUND(((AvgCurrent - AvgPrevious) / AvgPrevious) * 100, 1) END, 'N2') AS MoMGrowthPercent FROM MoMGrowth;
            
            NOTE: understand the difference between example 2 and example 3, in example 2 we are comparing april 2024 with march 2024, but in example 3 we are comparing march 2024 with april 2024... like that you have to understand the user query and generate the sql query accordingly.
            eg 3) : what is the growth for total products or Grand total in april  2024 and march 2024? -> then consider avg sale quantity/ total no of days in that month
            
            *- you have to calculate the no of days like above did. example this format: DAY(EOMONTH('YYYY-MM-01')) AS DaysInMonth .. ** you have to change according to the user mentioned month and year.**
            for better understanding of the query, you can refer the below example: 
            
            eg 4) user query: what is the mom growth for the Ghee in jan 2025 and feb 2025? --> sql query : WITH CurrentMonth AS (SELECT SUM(SalesQuantity) AS TotalSales, DAY(EOMONTH('2025-01-01')) AS DaysInMonth FROM DW.fSales WHERE ProductHeirachy1 = 'Ghee' AND BillingDate >= '2025-01-01' AND BillingDate < '2025-02-01'), PreviousMonth AS (SELECT SUM(SalesQuantity) AS TotalSales, DAY(EOMONTH('2025-02-01')) AS DaysInMonth FROM DW.fSales WHERE ProductHeirachy1 = 'Ghee' AND BillingDate >= '2025-02-01' AND BillingDate < '2025-03-01'), MoMGrowth AS (SELECT ROUND(CAST(CurrentMonth.TotalSales AS FLOAT) / NULLIF(CurrentMonth.DaysInMonth, 0) / 1000.0, 2) AS AvgCurrent, ROUND(CAST(PreviousMonth.TotalSales AS FLOAT) / NULLIF(PreviousMonth.DaysInMonth, 0) / 1000.0, 2) AS AvgPrevious FROM CurrentMonth, PreviousMonth) SELECT FORMAT(AvgCurrent, 'N2') AS AvgCurrent, FORMAT(AvgPrevious, 'N2') AS AvgPrevious, FORMAT(AvgCurrent - AvgPrevious, 'N2') AS Variance, FORMAT(CASE WHEN AvgPrevious = 0 THEN NULL ELSE ROUND(((AvgCurrent - AvgPrevious) / AvgPrevious) * 100, 1) END, 'N2') AS MoMGrowthPercent FROM MoMGrowth;
            ***VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: If the user query Any values realted to these columns : CITY, STATE, REGION_NAME, AREA_NAME, PLANT_NAME, or Short_Name, then perform an inner join on DW.fSales f and DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d using f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT and filter with d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office'.

    > INSTRUCTIONS:
        learn concept through Main logic examples and generate ssms sql query based on user query:

    MAIN LOGIC:
      MODEL 1 -> SEASONALITY, BEST SEASON, BEST MONTHS 
            meaning: Seasonality refers to predictable and recurring patterns or fluctuations in data over a specific period, usually within a year. In sales, seasonality means certain months or seasons consistently show higher or lower sales volumes.Seasonality refers to predictable and recurring patterns or fluctuations in data over a specific period, usually within a year. In sales, seasonality means certain months or seasons consistently show higher or lower sales volumes.Identify which months in a given year have the highest sales activity (peak sales months) for a specific product.
            - example 1: user query: what is the seasonality of a milk in 2024? -> sql query: SELECT TOP 3 MONTH(BillingDate) AS PeakSalesMonth, SUM(SalesQuantity) / COUNT(DISTINCT CAST(BillingDate AS DATE)) AS AvgSalesPerDay FROM Dw.fsales WHERE ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk' AND YEAR(BillingDate) = 2024 AND ProductHeirachy1 NOT IN ('Feed', 'Feed Supplement', 'Veterinary Medicines', 'Water', 'HERITA LIV', 'NULL', 'others') GROUP BY MONTH(BillingDate) ORDER BY AvgSalesPerDay DESC;
            - example 2: user query: what is the seasonality of milk tm in 2024 in telangana? -> sql query-> SELECT TOP 3 MONTH(f.BillingDate) AS PeakSalesMonth, SUM(f.SalesQuantity) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT CAST(f.BillingDate AS DATE)) AS AvgSalesPerDay FROM DW.fSales f INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON d.PLANT = f.SalesOfficeID WHERE f.ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk' AND f.ProductHeirachy3 = 'TM' AND YEAR(f.BillingDate) = 2024 AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'Sales Office' AND d.STATE = 'TELANGANA' AND f.ProductHeirachy1 NOT IN ('Feed', 'Feed Supplement', 'Veterinary Medicines', 'Water', 'HERITA LIV', 'NULL', 'others') GROUP BY MONTH(f.BillingDate) ORDER BY AvgSalesPerDay DESC;
       
        MODEL 2 -> NOT SEASONALITY, WORST SEASON, WORST MONTHS, LEAST PERFORMING MONTHS
            meaning: Not seasonality refers to the absence of predictable patterns or fluctuations in data over a specific period, indicating that sales do not consistently rise or fall during certain months or seasons. In this context, it means identifying months with lower sales activity for a specific product.
            - example 1: user query: what is the not seasonality of milk in 2024? -> sql query: SELECT TOP 3 MONTH(BillingDate) AS lessSalesMonth, SUM(SalesQuantity) / COUNT(DISTINCT CAST(BillingDate AS DATE)) AS AvgSalesPerDay FROM Dw.fsales WHERE ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk' AND YEAR(BillingDate) = 2024 AND ProductHeirachy1 NOT IN ('Feed', 'Feed Supplement', 'Veterinary Medicines', 'Water', 'HERITA LIV', 'NULL', 'others') GROUP BY MONTH(BillingDate) ORDER BY AvgSalesPerDay;
            - Example 2: user query: what is the worst season fo milk tm in 2024 in telangana? -> sql query: SELECT TOP 3 MONTH(f.BillingDate) AS lessSalesMonth, SUM(f.SalesQuantity) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT CAST(f.BillingDate AS DATE)) AS AvgSalesPerDay FROM DW.fSales f INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON d.PLANT = f.SalesOfficeID WHERE f.ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk' AND f.ProductHeirachy3 = 'TM' AND YEAR(f.BillingDate) = 2024 AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'Sales Office' AND d.STATE = 'TELANGANA' AND f.ProductHeirachy1 NOT IN ('Feed', 'Feed Supplement', 'Veterinary Medicines', 'Water', 'HERITA LIV', 'NULL', 'others') GROUP BY MONTH(f.BillingDate) ORDER BY AvgSalesPerDay ASC;

    > INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Before generating any SQL query, first identify which use case the user's query belongs to. Then, follow the correct pattern based on that use case and use the structure shown in the examples. Replace the product names, locations, date ranges, and other terms with the ones mentioned by the user. Finally, generate a clean, executable SQL Server (SSMS) query that strictly follows that use case logic and format.
    > 8 Usecases and their corresponding rules with examples: These are representative only. Do NOT confuse or mix models. Instead, UNDERSTAND the user query intent and SELECT the correct use case (e.g., product mentioned vs not mentioned in budget queries) before generating SQL. Your goal is not to memorize examples but to internalize the logic and structure so you can apply it accurately to similar or novel inputs.   
        1) sale quantity or volume or sale : always divide 
            meaning: The total number of units (or liters, kilograms, etc.) of a product that were sold in a specific period. that is divide with the time period
            - example 1 : user query : what is sale quantity of milk yesterday? -> sql query: SELECT SUM(SalesQuantity)/1 AS MilkSalesQuantity_Yesterday FROM Dw.fsales WHERE CAST(BillingDate AS DATE) = CAST(GETDATE() - 1 AS DATE) AND ProductHeirachy1 = 'MILK';  -- you has to find which column the user mentioned product belongs to
            - example 2 : user query : what is volume of curd lastweek ? -> sql query:SELECT SUM(SalesQuantity)/7.0 AS CurdSalesQuantity_LastWeek FROM Dw.fSales WHERE BillingDate BETWEEN DATEADD(DAY, -7, DATEADD(WEEK, DATEDIFF(WEEK, 0, GETDATE()), 0)) AND DATEADD(DAY, -1, DATEADD(WEEK, DATEDIFF(WEEK, 0, GETDATE()), 0)) AND ProductHeirachy1 = 'CURD'; -- Replace if your column or value for curd is different
            - example 3 : user query : what is the sale of milk from hso 1 yesterday ? -> sql query: SELECT SUM(f.SalesQuantity)/1 AS MilkSalesQuantity_Yesterday_HSO1 FROM Dw.fsales f INNER JOIN Dw.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office' WHERE CAST(f.BillingDate AS DATE) = CAST(GETDATE() - 1 AS DATE) AND f.ProductHeirachy1 = 'MILK'  -- or correct milk identifier AND d.Short_Name = 'HSO 1';
            - example 4: user query : what is the sale of milk lastmonth ? -> sql query: SELECT SUM(SalesQuantity)/ DAY(EOMONTH(DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE()))) AS MilkSalesQuantity_LastMonth FROM DW.fSales WHERE ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk' AND BillingDate >= DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(GETDATE()), MONTH(GETDATE()) - 1, 1) AND BillingDate < DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(GETDATE()), MONTH(GETDATE()), 1) AND ProductHeirachy1 NOT IN ('Feed', 'Feed Supplement', 'Veterinary Medicines', 'Water', 'HERITA LIV', 'NULL', 'others')
            - example 5: user query: what is the sale of milk in hyderabad yesterday ? -> sql query: WITH MilkMaterialCodes AS (SELECT DISTINCT MaterialCode FROM DW.fSales WHERE ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk' AND ProductHeirachy1 NOT IN ('Feed', 'Feed Supplement', 'Veterinary Medicines', 'Water', 'HERITA LIV', 'NULL', 'others')), Actual AS (SELECT SUM(f.SalesQuantity) / 1 AS actual FROM DW.fSales f INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON d.PLANT = f.SalesOfficeID INNER JOIN MilkMaterialCodes m ON f.MaterialCode = m.MaterialCode WHERE d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office' AND f.BillingDate = CAST(GETDATE() - 1 AS DATE) AND d.CITY = 'HYDERABAD') SELECT actual FROM Actual;
            - example 6: user query : what is the sale of milk in april 2025 ? -> sql query: select sum(SalesQuantity)/30.0 from DW.fSales where ProductHeirachy1='milk' and BillingDate between '2025-04-01' and '2025-04-30'
            - example 7: user query: what is the sale of hyd city -> sql query: select SUM(f.SalesQuantity)/1.0 from dw.fsales f inner join DW.dSalesOfficeMaster  d on d.PLANT=f.SalesOfficeID where d.CITY= 'hyderabad' and [Sales Offcie Type]='sales Office'
            like this you has to dynamically adjust to user query and generate the sql query with proper column names and date filters they may ask by mentioning CITY,STATE, REGION_NAME, Short_Name etc and also by date filters like mtd,qtd, ytd. donot get confused just think and genarete based upon the financial year (starts on 1st April of the current year & ends on 31st March of the following year)
            Important: Always calculate SalesQuantity as a daily average by dividing SUM(SalesQuantity) by the number of days in the period—use full days for past periods, and for the current month, divide only up to yesterday (e.g., if today is May 23, 2025, divide May data by 22 days). 
        
        2) budget: SUM(SalesQuantity) / 30.0 or 31.0 based on days in month AS TotalVolume and SUM(BudgetQuantityLPD) AS TargetVolume percentage: if any product mention then you have to consider material code
            meaning: Budget is the planned goal, Target is the assigned portion of that goal, Actual is what was really achieved, and Achievement is the percentage of target achieved = (Actual / Target) × 100.
            model 1) user had mentioned product : you have to generate like this definitely with the material codes only 
                    example 1: user query: what is the budget for milk in  hso 1 in april 2025 ?(with product filter) -> sql -> WITH MilkMaterialCodes AS (SELECT DISTINCT MaterialCode FROM DW.fSales WHERE ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk' AND ProductHeirachy1 NOT IN ('Feed', 'Feed Supplement', 'Veterinary Medicines', 'Water', 'HERITA LIV', 'NULL', 'others')), Actual AS (SELECT SUM(f.SalesQuantity) / 30.0 AS actual FROM DW.fSales f INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON d.PLANT = f.SalesOfficeID INNER JOIN MilkMaterialCodes m ON f.MaterialCode = m.MaterialCode WHERE d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office' AND f.BillingDate BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30' AND d.short_name = 'hso 1'), Target AS (SELECT SUM(b.BudgetQuantityLPD) AS target FROM DW.fSalesBudget b INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON d.PLANT = b.SalesOfficeID INNER JOIN MilkMaterialCodes m ON b.MaterialCode = m.MaterialCode WHERE d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office' AND b.PlanMonth = '202504' AND d.Short_Name = 'hso 1') SELECT a.actual, t.target, CASE WHEN t.target = 0 THEN NULL ELSE (a.actual / t.target) * 100 END AS AchievementPercent FROM Actual a, Target t;   
            model 2) user not mentioned product : 
                - example 1: user query: what is the budget for hyderabad in april 2025 ? (without product filter) -> sql -> WITH PlantID AS (SELECT PLANT FROM Dw.dSalesOfficeMaster WHERE CITY = 'Hyderabad' AND [Sales Offcie Type] = 'Sales Office'), TargetVolume AS (SELECT SUM(BudgetQuantityLPD) AS TargetVolume FROM Dw.fSalesBudget b INNER JOIN PlantID p ON b.SalesOfficeID = p.PLANT WHERE PlanMonth = '202504'), TotalVolume AS (SELECT SUM(SalesQuantity) / 30.0 AS TotalVolume FROM Dw.fSales f INNER JOIN PlantID p ON f.SalesOfficeID = p.PLANT WHERE BillingDate BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30') SELECT t.TargetVolume, s.TotalVolume, CASE WHEN t.TargetVolume = 0 THEN NULL ELSE (s.TotalVolume / t.TargetVolume) * 100 END AS AchievementPercent FROM TargetVolume t, TotalVolume s;
                - example 2: user query: what is the budget for hso 1 in april 2025 ? -> sql -> WITH PlantID AS (SELECT PLANT FROM Dw.dSalesOfficeMaster WHERE Short_Name = 'HSO 1' AND [Sales Offcie Type] = 'Sales Office'), TargetVolume AS (SELECT SUM(BudgetQuantityLPD) AS TargetVolume FROM Dw.fSalesBudget b INNER JOIN PlantID p ON b.SalesOfficeID = p.PLANT WHERE PlanMonth = '202504'), TotalVolume AS (SELECT SUM(SalesQuantity) / 30.0 AS TotalVolume FROM Dw.fSales f INNER JOIN PlantID p ON f.SalesOfficeID = p.PLANT WHERE BillingDate BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30') SELECT t.TargetVolume, s.TotalVolume, CASE WHEN t.TargetVolume = 0 THEN NULL ELSE (s.TotalVolume / t.TargetVolume) * 100 END AS AchievementPercent FROM TargetVolume t, TotalVolume s;
                - example 3: user query : what is the budget of TG 2 in apil 2025 ? -> sql -> WITH PlantID AS (SELECT PLANT FROM Dw.dSalesOfficeMaster WHERE REGION_NAME = 'TG-2' AND [Sales Offcie Type] = 'Sales Office'), TargetVolume AS (SELECT SUM(BudgetQuantityLPD) AS TargetVolume FROM Dw.fSalesBudget b INNER JOIN PlantID p ON b.SalesOfficeID = p.PLANT WHERE PlanMonth = '202504'), TotalVolume AS (SELECT SUM(SalesQuantity) / 30.0 AS TotalVolume FROM Dw.fSales f INNER JOIN PlantID p ON f.SalesOfficeID = p.PLANT WHERE BillingDate BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30') SELECT t.TargetVolume, s.TotalVolume, CASE WHEN t.TargetVolume = 0 THEN NULL ELSE (s.TotalVolume / t.TargetVolume) * 100 END AS AchievementPercent FROM TargetVolume t, TotalVolume s;
                The above are the main examples users may ask as their wish but you has to calculate the target and actual and also achievement for every budget related query
                If user mentions a city (e.g., "Hyderabad"), replace d.Short_Name = '...' with d.CITY = 'HYDERABAD'; if user mentions a region (e.g., "TG-2"), replace with d.REGION_NAME = 'TG-2'; if a product is mentioned (e.g., "Milk"), add f.ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk'; if no product is mentioned, apply no filter on ProductHeirachy1 and use SUM(f.SalesQuantity) for all products. Note: planMonth plays a crucial role in calculating the budget understand they mention april 2024 means you have to do PlanMonth = '202404' which is in 'YYYYMM' format
                while calculating actual identify no of days in that month clearly (eg..if may means SUM(f.SalesQuantity) / 31.0) refer this once ; - Days in Each Month (Fixed): Jan–31, Feb–28 (29 in leap years), Mar–31, Apr–30, May–31, Jun–30, Jul–31, Aug–31, Sep–30, Oct–31, Nov–30, Dec–31.
        3) top performing: 
            model 1) top performing based on budget : 
                - example 1: user query : top performing sales office (no product mentioned) ? sql query -> WITH ActualSales AS (SELECT d.Short_Name, SUM(f.SalesQuantity) / 30.0 AS actual FROM DW.fSales f INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON d.PLANT = f.SalesOfficeID WHERE d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office' AND f.BillingDate BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30' GROUP BY d.Short_Name), Budget AS (SELECT d.Short_Name, SUM(b.BudgetQuantityLPD) AS TotalBudgetQuantityLPD FROM DW.fSalesBudget b INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON d.PLANT = b.SalesOfficeID WHERE d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office' AND b.PlanMonth = '202504' GROUP BY d.Short_Name) SELECT b.Short_Name, b.TotalBudgetQuantityLPD, a.actual, CASE WHEN b.TotalBudgetQuantityLPD = 0 THEN NULL ELSE (a.actual / b.TotalBudgetQuantityLPD) * 100 END AS AchievementPercent FROM Budget b LEFT JOIN ActualSales a ON b.Short_Name = a.Short_Name ORDER BY AchievementPercent DESC; WITH ActualSales AS (SELECT d.Short_Name, SUM(f.SalesQuantity) / 30.0 AS actual FROM DW.fSales f INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON d.PLANT = f.SalesOfficeID WHERE d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office' AND f.BillingDate BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30' GROUP BY d.Short_Name), Budget AS (SELECT d.Short_Name, SUM(b.BudgetQuantityLPD) AS TotalBudgetQuantityLPD FROM DW.fSalesBudget b INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON d.PLANT = b.SalesOfficeID WHERE d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office' AND b.PlanMonth = '202504' GROUP BY d.Short_Name) SELECT b.Short_Name, a.actual FROM Budget b LEFT JOIN ActualSales a ON b.Short_Name = a.Short_Name ORDER BY a.actual DESC;
                - example 2 : user query : top performing sales office (product mentioned) ? sql query -> WITH MilkMaterialCodes AS (SELECT DISTINCT MaterialCode FROM DW.fSales WHERE ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk' AND ProductHeirachy1 NOT IN ('Feed', 'Feed Supplement', 'Veterinary Medicines', 'Water', 'HERITA LIV', 'NULL', 'others')), ActualSales AS (SELECT d.Short_Name, SUM(f.SalesQuantity) / 30.0 AS actual FROM DW.fSales f INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON d.PLANT = f.SalesOfficeID INNER JOIN MilkMaterialCodes m ON f.MaterialCode = m.MaterialCode WHERE d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office' AND f.BillingDate BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30' GROUP BY d.Short_Name), Budget AS (SELECT d.Short_Name, SUM(b.BudgetQuantityLPD) AS TotalBudgetQuantityLPD FROM DW.fSalesBudget b INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON d.PLANT = b.SalesOfficeID INNER JOIN MilkMaterialCodes m ON b.MaterialCode = m.MaterialCode WHERE d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office' AND b.PlanMonth = '202504' GROUP BY d.Short_Name) SELECT b.Short_Name, b.TotalBudgetQuantityLPD, a.actual, CASE WHEN b.TotalBudgetQuantityLPD = 0 THEN NULL ELSE (a.actual / b.TotalBudgetQuantityLPD) * 100 END AS AchievementPercent FROM Budget b LEFT JOIN ActualSales a ON b.Short_Name = a.Short_Name ORDER BY AchievementPercent DESC;
                you has to calculate like this for state,city, or if any specifically mention
            If user mentions a city (e.g., "Hyderabad"), replace d.Short_Name = '...' with d.CITY = 'HYDERABAD'; if user mentions a region (e.g., "TG-2"), replace with d.REGION_NAME = 'TG-2'; if a product is mentioned (e.g., "Milk"), add f.ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk'; if no product is mentioned, apply no filter on ProductHeirachy1 and use SUM(f.SalesQuantity) for all products.
           model 2) top performing products based on net realization:
                meaning: Net Realization (also called Net Realized Value or Net Sales Realization) refers to the actual revenue per unit a company earns after deducting all discounts, taxes, and other selling expenses from the gross sales. In simple terms: Net Realization = (Total Net Amount) ÷ (Total Sales Quantity)
                - example 1: user query :what are the top performing products based on net realization or nrv? sql -> SELECT TOP 5 ProductHeirachy1, SUM(TotalAmount) / NULLIF(SUM(SalesQuantity), 0) AS AvgPricePerUnit FROM DW.fsales GROUP BY ProductHeirachy1 ORDER BY AvgPricePerUnit DESC;
                - example 2: user query : what are the top performing products in hyderabad based on net realization or nrv? sql -> SELECT TOP 5 f.ProductHeirachy1, SUM(f.NetAmount) / NULLIF(SUM(f.SalesQuantity), 0) AS NetRealization FROM DW.fSales f INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'Sales Office' WHERE d.CITY = 'HYDERABAD' AND f.IsActive = 1 AND f.SalesQuantity > 0 AND f.BillingDate BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30' GROUP BY f.ProductHeirachy1 ORDER BY NetRealization DESC;
                - example 3: user query : what are the top perfroming products in hyd sales office 1 based on net realization or nrv? sql -> SELECT TOP 5 f.ProductHeirachy1, SUM(f.NetAmount) / NULLIF(SUM(f.SalesQuantity), 0) AS NetRealization FROM DW.fSales f INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'Sales Office' WHERE d.Short_Name = 'HSO 1'  AND f.SalesQuantity > 0 AND f.BillingDate BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30' GROUP BY f.ProductHeirachy1 ORDER BY NetRealization DESC;
            model 3) top performing products based on average sale quantity:
                - example 1: user query: what are the top performing products in april 2025 based on  sale quantity? -> sql -> SELECT TOP 5 ProductHeirachy1, SUM(SalesQuantity) / 30.0 AS AvgDailySale FROM DW.fSales WHERE BillingDate BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30' GROUP BY ProductHeirachy1 ORDER BY AvgDailySale DESC; filter by CITY or Short_Name using DW.dSalesOfficeMaster if user specifies a city or sales office.
                - example 2: what are the top performing products in hyd sales office 1 based on average sale quantity? -> sql -> SELECT TOP 5 f.ProductHeirachy1, SUM(f.SalesQuantity) / 30.0 AS AvgDailySale FROM DW.fSales f JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT WHERE d.Short_Name = 'HSO 1' AND f.BillingDate BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30' GROUP BY f.ProductHeirachy1 ORDER BY AvgDailySale DESC
        4) not performing or less performing : you have to follow above (top performing logic.. usecase 3) but display in ascending order
        5) ubc or unique billing count or unique billing customers:
            meaning: Number of unique customers based on the CustomerID column in Dw.fsales table.
            - example1: user query: what is unique billing count yesterday?  -> sql query: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT BillingDocument) AS UniqueBillingCount_Yesterday FROM Dw.fsales WHERE CAST(BillingDate AS DATE) = CAST(GETDATE() - 1 AS DATE);
            - example2: user query: what is dnu yesterday?  -> sql query: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT BillingDocument) AS UniqueBillingCount_Yesterday FROM Dw.fsales WHERE CAST(BillingDate AS DATE) = CAST(GETDATE() - 1 AS DATE);
       6) unbilled customers or not billed customers: 
            meaning: Unbilled customers are those customers who made a purchase (were billed) in the previous month but did not make any purchase (were not billed) in the current month.
            - example 1: user query: who are unbilled customers from the agents for April 2025 ?-> sql query: WITH CustomersBilledInApril AS (SELECT DISTINCT CustomerID FROM Dw.fSales WHERE BillingDate >= '2025-04-01' AND BillingDate < '2025-05-01' AND CustomerGroup = 'agents'), CustomersBilledInMarch AS (SELECT DISTINCT CustomerID FROM Dw.fSales WHERE BillingDate >= '2025-03-01' AND BillingDate < '2025-04-01' AND CustomerGroup = 'agents'), UnbilledCustomers AS (SELECT m.CustomerID FROM CustomersBilledInMarch m LEFT JOIN CustomersBilledInApril a ON m.CustomerID = a.CustomerID WHERE a.CustomerID IS NULL) SELECT 'Count' AS Type, CAST(COUNT(*) AS VARCHAR) AS Value FROM UnbilledCustomers UNION ALL SELECT 'CustomerID' AS Type, CAST(CustomerID AS VARCHAR) AS Value FROM UnbilledCustomers;IMPORTANT OBSERVATION: user just mentiond the single month but we automatically compares with its previous month.
            - example 2: user query: show me who are ubilled customers from the agents in hso1 for april 2025? -> sql query: WITH CustomersBilledInApril AS (SELECT DISTINCT f.CustomerID FROM Dw.fSales f JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office' WHERE f.BillingDate >= '2025-04-01' AND f.BillingDate < '2025-05-01' AND f.CustomerGroup = 'agents' AND d.Short_Name = 'hso 1'), CustomersBilledInMarch AS (SELECT DISTINCT f.CustomerID FROM Dw.fSales f JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office' WHERE f.BillingDate >= '2025-03-01' AND f.BillingDate < '2025-04-01' AND f.CustomerGroup = 'agents' AND d.Short_Name = 'hso 1'), UnbilledCustomers AS (SELECT m.CustomerID FROM CustomersBilledInMarch m LEFT JOIN CustomersBilledInApril a ON m.CustomerID = a.CustomerID WHERE a.CustomerID IS NULL) SELECT 'Count' AS Type, CAST(COUNT(*) AS VARCHAR) AS Value FROM UnbilledCustomers UNION ALL SELECT 'CustomerID' AS Type, CAST(CustomerID AS VARCHAR) AS Value FROM UnbilledCustomers;
        7)  MAIN LOGIC:
    -> month on month comparison: print avg sale along with percentage
            meaning: Month-on-Month comparison is a way to measure how a metric (here, sales quantity) changes from one month to the next, usually expressed as a percentage growth or decline.

Additional important Note on Input Dates: 1) If the user provides a date range covering two months or more, use the above MoM formula to compare the specified months. 2)If the user mentions only a single month, then instead of comparing with the previous month, compare the product's sales in that month with the same month in the previous year (Year-on-Year comparison for that month).

            NOTE: understand the difference between example 2 and example 3, in example 2 we are comparing april 2024 with march 2024, but in example 3 we are comparing march 2024 with april 2024... like that you have to understand the user query and generate the sql query accordingly.
            **- example 4: what is the growth for total products or Grand total in april  2024 and march 2024? -> then consider avg sale quantity/ total no of days in that month
            *- you have to calculate the no of days like above did. example this format: DAY(EOMONTH('2024-04-01')) AS DaysInMonth
            If user mentions a city (e.g., "Hyderabad") with d.CITY = 'HYDERABAD'; if user mentions a region (e.g., "TG-2"), replace with d.REGION_NAME = 'TG-2'; if a product is mentioned (e.g., "Milk"), add f.ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk' or hso 1 means : replace d.Short_Name = '...'; if no product is mentioned, apply no filter on ProductHeirachy1 and use SUM(f.SalesQuantity) for all products. like this you have to map other tables
            for better understanding of the query, you can refer the below example: 
                ** user query: what is the mom growth for the Ghee in jan 2025 and feb 2025? --> sql query : WITH CurrentMonth AS (SELECT SUM(SalesQuantity) / 31.0 AS AvgCurrent FROM DW.fSales WHERE ProductHeirachy1 = 'Ghee' AND BillingDate >= '2025-01-01' AND BillingDate < '2025-02-01'), PreviousMonth AS (SELECT SUM(SalesQuantity) / 28.0 AS AvgPrevious FROM DW.fSales WHERE ProductHeirachy1 = 'Ghee' AND BillingDate >= '2025-02-01' AND BillingDate < '2025-03-01') SELECT AvgCurrent, AvgPrevious, AvgCurrent - AvgPrevious AS Variance, CASE WHEN AvgPrevious = 0 THEN NULL ELSE ROUND(((AvgCurrent - AvgPrevious) / AvgPrevious) * 100, 1) END AS MoMGrowthPercent FROM CurrentMonth, PreviousMonth;
            
            ***VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: If the user query Any values realted to these columns : CITY, STATE, REGION_NAME, AREA_NAME, PLANT_NAME, or Short_Name, then perform an inner join on DW.fSales f and DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d using f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT and filter with d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office'.

        8) seasonality: 
            meaning: Seasonality refers to predictable and recurring patterns or fluctuations in data over a specific period, usually within a year. In sales, seasonality means certain months or seasons consistently show higher or lower sales volumes.Seasonality refers to predictable and recurring patterns or fluctuations in data over a specific period, usually within a year. In sales, seasonality means certain months or seasons consistently show higher or lower sales volumes.Identify which months in a given year have the highest sales activity (peak sales months) for a specific product.
            - example 1: user query: what is the seasonality of a milk in 2024? -> sql query: SELECT TOP 3 MONTH(BillingDate) AS PeakSalesMonth, SUM(SalesQuantity) / COUNT(DISTINCT CAST(BillingDate AS DATE)) AS AvgSalesPerDay FROM Dw.fsales WHERE ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk' AND YEAR(BillingDate) = 2024 AND ProductHeirachy1 NOT IN ('Feed', 'Feed Supplement', 'Veterinary Medicines', 'Water', 'HERITA LIV', 'NULL', 'others') GROUP BY MONTH(BillingDate) ORDER BY AvgSalesPerDay DESC;
            - example 2: user query: what is the seasonality of milk tm in 2024 in telangana? -> sql query-> SELECT TOP 3 MONTH(f.BillingDate) AS PeakSalesMonth, SUM(f.SalesQuantity) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT CAST(f.BillingDate AS DATE)) AS AvgSalesPerDay FROM DW.fSales f INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON d.PLANT = f.SalesOfficeID WHERE f.ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk' AND f.ProductHeirachy3 = 'TM' AND YEAR(f.BillingDate) = 2024 AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'Sales Office' AND d.STATE = 'TELANGANA' AND f.ProductHeirachy1 NOT IN ('Feed', 'Feed Supplement', 'Veterinary Medicines', 'Water', 'HERITA LIV', 'NULL', 'others') GROUP BY MONTH(f.BillingDate) ORDER BY AvgSalesPerDay DESC;

    > edge case terms to handle:
        • If the user query mentions "icecream/fd", "ice cream/fd", "frozen dessert", or any variation that explicitly includes "fd":
             → Then use: Materialgroup = 'ICE CREAM/FD'
        (Make sure it's in uppercase and enclosed in single quotes.)
        • If the user query mentions only "icecream" or "ice cream" without "fd" or "frozen dessert":
            → Then apply filter using Product Hierarchy only (e.g., ProductHeirachy1 to ProductHeirachy5), based on context or available values.
        • Do not use both Product Hierarchy and Materialgroup for "ice cream" unless explicitly mentioned.
         • If the user query mentions "flav.milk' or 'flavoured milk' or 'flav milk' then Consider: ProductHeirachy1 = 'flav.milk'
         'flav.milk' and 'milk' are different but both present in the ProductHeirachy1 search carefully

    > INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Before generating any SQL query, first identify which use case the user's query belongs to. Then, follow the correct pattern based on that use case and use the structure shown in the examples. Replace the product names, locations, date ranges, and other terms with the ones mentioned by the user. Finally, generate a clean, executable SQL Server (SSMS) query that strictly follows that use case logic and format.

        MAIN LOGIC: for top performing and less perfroming query 
        MODEL 1 ->  top performing products based on NET REALIZATION (NRV): ALSO CALLED AS VALUE ADDED PRODUCTS (VAP)
                meaning: Net Realization (also called Net Realized Value or Net Sales Realization) refers to the actual revenue per unit a company earns after deducting all discounts, taxes, and other selling expenses from the gross sales. In simple terms: Net Realization = (Total Net Amount) ÷ (Total Sales Quantity)
                - example 1: user query :what are the top performing products based on net realization or nrv? sql -> SELECT TOP 5 ProductHeirachy1, SUM(TotalAmount) / NULLIF(SUM(SalesQuantity), 0) AS AvgPricePerUnit FROM DW.fsales GROUP BY ProductHeirachy1 ORDER BY AvgPricePerUnit DESC;
                - example 2: user query : what are the top performing products in hyderabad based on net realization or nrv? sql -> SELECT TOP 5 f.ProductHeirachy1, SUM(f.NetAmount) / NULLIF(SUM(f.SalesQuantity), 0) AS NetRealization FROM DW.fSales f INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'Sales Office' WHERE d.CITY = 'HYDERABAD' AND f.IsActive = 1 AND f.SalesQuantity > 0 AND f.BillingDate BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30' GROUP BY f.ProductHeirachy1 ORDER BY NetRealization DESC;
                - example 3: user query : what are the top perfroming products in hyd sales office 1 based on net realization or nrv? sql -> SELECT TOP 5 f.ProductHeirachy1, SUM(f.NetAmount) / NULLIF(SUM(f.SalesQuantity), 0) AS NetRealization FROM DW.fSales f INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'Sales Office' WHERE d.Short_Name = 'HSO 1'  AND f.SalesQuantity > 0 AND f.BillingDate BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30' GROUP BY f.ProductHeirachy1 ORDER BY NetRealization DESC;
                IMP - profit gaining products will also be considered as top performing products based on net realization or nrv.
        MODEL 2--> if user asked about less performing or no perfroming means you have to consider ascending the sql query format is same but you have to change to ascending just display in that
                -example 1: what are loss making products? -> sql query : SELECT TOP 5 ProductHeirachy1, SUM(TotalAmount) / NULLIF(SUM(SalesQuantity), 0) AS AvgPricePerUnit FROM DW.fsales GROUP BY ProductHeirachy1 ORDER BY AvgPricePerUnit ASC;

    > INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Before generating any SQL query, first identify which use case the user's query belongs to. Then, follow the correct pattern based on that use case and use the structure shown in the examples. Replace the product names, locations, date ranges, and other terms with the ones mentioned by the user. Finally, generate a clean, executable SQL Server (SSMS) query that strictly follows that use case logic and format.

        MAIN LOGIC for top performing and less perfroming query:
        eg: Top performing sku yesterday ? SQL : SELECT TOP 5 ProductHeirachy1, ProductHeirachy3, ProductHeirachy4, ProductHeirachy5, ProductHeirachy2, SUM(SalesQuantity) AS TotalSalesQuantity FROM DW.fSales WHERE BillingDate = CAST(GETDATE() - 1 AS DATE) GROUP BY MaterialCode, ProductHeirachy1, ProductHeirachy2, ProductHeirachy3, ProductHeirachy4, ProductHeirachy5 ORDER BY TotalSalesQuantity DESC;
        ->  less or bottom or not performing or any related to this means just use above logic with ASC order

        Note: If the question refers to a single day (e.g., "yesterday", "on 5th June 2025"), then do not divide SalesQuantity by the number of days. If the question refers to a date range (like "last week", "last month", "MTD", "QTD", "YTD", or any two specific dates), then you must divide the total SalesQuantity by the number of days in that period to get the daily average
        eg: Top performing SKUs in May 2025? sql ; WITH PeriodSales AS (SELECT ProductHeirachy1, ProductHeirachy2, ProductHeirachy3, ProductHeirachy4, ProductHeirachy5, SUM(SalesQuantity) * 1.0 / DAY(EOMONTH('2025-05-01')) AS AvgDailySalesQuantity FROM DW.fSales WHERE BillingDate >= '2025-05-01' AND BillingDate < '2025-06-01' GROUP BY ProductHeirachy1, ProductHeirachy2, ProductHeirachy3, ProductHeirachy4, ProductHeirachy5) SELECT TOP 5 ProductHeirachy1, ProductHeirachy2, ProductHeirachy3, ProductHeirachy4, ProductHeirachy5, AvgDailySalesQuantity FROM PeriodSales ORDER BY AvgDailySalesQuantity DESC;

    MAIN LOGIC:  UNBILLED CUSTOMERS: means customers who made a purchase in the previous month but did not make any purchase in the current month. -> UNBILLED customers or not billed customers: 
        meaning: Unbilled customers are those customers who made a purchase (were billed) in the previous month but did not make any purchase (were not billed) in the current month.

        - understand the user question properly, use date_logic_and_fiscal_rules for calculating dates etc.
        - learn concept through examples and generate ssms sql query by understanding user query properly.
        very imp: Whenever the query contains location filters such as CITY, STATE, REGION, PLANT_NAME, Short_Name then SQL must join DW.fSales (f) with DW.dSalesOfficeMaster (d) using f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT and filter on the location fields from d. Additionally, always include d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office'
        "actual logic: If the question refers to a single specific day (e.g., 'yesterday', 'on 5th June 2025'), use the total SalesQuantity without dividing. If the question refers to a date range (e.g., 'last week', 'MTD', 'QTD', 'YTD', or two dates), then divide the total SalesQuantity by the number of days in that range to calculate the daily average — do not assume 1 day for ranges."
        This makes it clear: # Single day → no division #Range → divide by actual number of days #Never assume 1 when it's a range

        - To get PlanMonth, take the year and month from the target date and combine them as YYYYMM (e.g., for April 2025, year = 2025 and month = 04, so PlanMonth = 202504).
        - NEVER : Don't consider BillingDate for the target date, always use PlanMonth.
    
    > MAIN LOGIC:    
    examples: 
    eg 1) what is the achievement of april 2025 ? SQL: WITH Actual AS (SELECT SUM(SalesQuantity) * 1.0 / 30.0 AS Actual FROM DW.fSales f JOIN Dw.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT WHERE BillingDate BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30' AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'Sales Office' AND ProductHeirachy1 NOT IN ('Feed', 'Feed Supplement', 'Veterinary Medicines', 'Water', 'HERITA LIV', 'NULL', 'others')), Target AS (SELECT SUM(BudgetQuantityLPD) AS Target FROM [worddb].[HFLSQLReader].[Budgets_mapping] b JOIN Dw.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON b.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT WHERE PlanMonth = 202504) SELECT a.Actual, t.Target, CASE WHEN t.Target = 0 THEN NULL ELSE (a.Actual / t.Target) * 100 END AS AchievementPercent FROM Actual a, Target t;
    
    yesterday target means : you can consider planmonth like this : b.PlanMonth = CAST(FORMAT(GETDATE() - 1, 'yyyyMM') AS INT)
    lastmonth target means : you can consider planmonth like this : b.PlanMonth = CAST(FORMAT(DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE()), 'yyyyMM') AS INT)
    like example : 
    eg 2) what is the achievement of lastmonth ? SQL : WITH Actual AS (SELECT SUM(f.SalesQuantity) * 1.0 / DAY(EOMONTH(DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE()))) AS Actual FROM DW.fSales f JOIN Dw.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT WHERE f.BillingDate BETWEEN DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE())), MONTH(DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE())), 1) AND EOMONTH(DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE())) AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'Sales Office' AND f.ProductHeirachy1 NOT IN ('Feed', 'Feed Supplement', 'Veterinary Medicines', 'Water', 'HERITA LIV', 'NULL', 'others')), Target AS (SELECT SUM(BudgetQuantityLPD) AS Target FROM [worddb].[HFLSQLReader].[Budgets_mapping] b JOIN Dw.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON b.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT WHERE PlanMonth = CAST(FORMAT(DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE()), 'yyyyMM') AS INT)) SELECT a.Actual, t.Target, CASE WHEN t.Target = 0 THEN NULL ELSE (a.Actual / t.Target) * 100 END AS AchievementPercent FROM Actual a, Target t;

    eg 3) what is the budget of milk in the hso1 in may 2025 ? SQL : WITH Actual AS (SELECT SUM(f.SalesQuantity) * 1.0 / 31.0 AS Actual FROM DW.fSales f JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT WHERE f.BillingDate BETWEEN '2025-05-01' AND '2025-05-31' AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'Sales Office' AND d.Short_Name = 'HSO 1' AND f.ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk' AND f.ProductHeirachy1 NOT IN ('Feed', 'Feed Supplement', 'Veterinary Medicines', 'Water', 'HERITA LIV', 'NULL', 'others')), Target AS (SELECT SUM(b.BudgetQuantityLPD) AS Target FROM [worddb].[HFLSQLReader].[Budgets_mapping] b JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON b.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT WHERE b.PlanMonth = 202505 AND d.Short_Name = 'HSO 1' AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'Sales Office' AND ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk') SELECT a.Actual, t.Target, CASE WHEN t.Target = 0 THEN NULL ELSE (a.Actual / t.Target) * 100 END AS AchievementPercent FROM Actual a, Target t;

    eg 4) what is the budget of milk  in may 2025 ? SQL: WITH Actual AS (SELECT SUM(f.SalesQuantity) * 1.0 / 31.0 AS Actual FROM DW.fSales f JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT WHERE f.BillingDate BETWEEN '2025-05-01' AND '2025-05-31' AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'Sales Office' AND f.ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk' AND f.ProductHeirachy1 NOT IN ('Feed', 'Feed Supplement', 'Veterinary Medicines', 'Water', 'HERITA LIV', 'NULL', 'others')), Target AS (SELECT SUM(b.BudgetQuantityLPD) AS Target FROM [worddb].[HFLSQLReader].[Budgets_mapping] b JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON b.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT WHERE b.PlanMonth = 202505 AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'Sales Office' AND b.ProductHeirachy1 = 'Milk') SELECT a.Actual, t.Target, CASE WHEN t.Target = 0 THEN NULL ELSE (a.Actual / t.Target) * 100 END AS AchievementPercent FROM Actual a, Target t;

    IMP : The user will give only values (e.g., 'Milk', 'HSO 1'); you must identify the correct column they belong to (like ProductHeirachy1 or Short_Name) and apply the same filter in both Actual and Target queries—do not use unrelated columns.

    MAIN LOGIC:
    **Important Note: The following examples cover common ways users may ask about UBC  If a user query differs in wording or format, interpret the intent and generate the SQL by adapting the logic shown in these examples. Always use them as reference patterns for solving similar queries.**

        usually we calculate ubc like this: 
        eg 1)what is unique billing count yesterday? -> SQL: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT BillingDocument) AS UniqueBillingCount_Yesterday FROM Dw.fsales WHERE CAST(BillingDate AS DATE) = CAST(GETDATE() - 1 AS DATE);

    > INSTRUCTIONS:
        - understand the user question properly, use date_logic_and_fiscal_rules for calculating dates etc.
        - learn concept through examples and generate ssms sql query by understanding user query properly.
        very imp: Whenever the query contains location filters such as CITY, STATE, REGION, PLANT_NAME, Short_Name then SQL must join DW.fSales (f) with DW.dSalesOfficeMaster (d) using f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT and filter on the location fields from d. Additionally, always include d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office'
        "SalesQuantity Logic: If the question refers to a single specific day (e.g., 'yesterday', 'on 5th June 2025'), use the total SalesQuantity without dividing. If the question refers to a date range (e.g., 'last week', 'MTD', 'QTD', 'YTD', or two dates), then divide the total SalesQuantity by the number of days in that range to calculate the daily average — do not assume 1 day for ranges."
        This makes it clear: # Single day → no division #Range → divide by actual number of days #Never assume 1 when it's a range

    MAIN LOGIC:
       #usecase 1: sale quantity or volume or sale calculation:

        #usecase 2:top performing(descending order), bottom performing(ascending order)
        eg 3) what are the bottom performing or less performing states based on the sale of april 2025 ? SQL: SELECT TOP 5 d.STATE, SUM(f.SalesQuantity) * 1.0 / 30 AS AvgSalesPerDay FROM DW.fSales f INNER JOIN DW.dSalesOfficeMaster d ON f.SalesOfficeID = d.PLANT WHERE f.BillingDate >= '2025-04-01' AND f.BillingDate <= '2025-04-30' AND d.[Sales Offcie Type] = 'sales Office' AND f.ProductHeirachy1 NOT IN ('Feed', 'Feed Supplement', 'Veterinary Medicines', 'Water', 'HERITA LIV', 'NULL', 'others') GROUP BY d.STATE ORDER BY AvgSalesPerDay;

        "Using the same logic as the base query, dynamically adjust the SQL based on the user query by including relevant filters for products, locations, and dates, and ensure all calculations like totals and averages are done correctly with product exclusions and correct joins."
